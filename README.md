# Assignment 1: Git Readme

## Websites vs Web Applications

### Websites are more commonly known about on the internet. They are meant to inform people about something and not be interacted with much. On the other hand web applications are made to be interacted with heavily.

## VS Code & Extensions

### I used VS when I had to do a web-design class. I still have some of the notes for the class. The only extension that is on there is the one that makes it more colorful. 

## Version Control, Git, & GitHub

### Vesion Control is something that is related to Git and GitHub. Github is something that has been mentioned in passing at various times thorughout the days of the earth. Git is probably just the nickname for GitHub.

## Markdown & Documentation

### Markdowns are the things that make text more interesting. Like making it Italics or bold. Documentation is designing a website using code.
